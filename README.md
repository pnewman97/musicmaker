This uses the JMusic library to create a random chord progression and random melody and play them together.


To get working,

1. download the latest version of jmusic (jmusic1.6.5.jar) right here https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmusic/files/jMusic_Stable/1.6.5/
2. open up eclipse and start a new java project
3. import the library: right click on your project, then "build path" -> "add external archives" -> click the jmusic.jar file you downloaded
4. put the code from  Music.java in the class and press Run!

Alternatively, the easiest way to get the full program up and running is to download and run the JAR file for the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lBSVVScN3osl9hikDx70WStSDo3nu_Xy/view">here</a>.
