This uses the JMusic library to create a random chord progression and random melody and play them together.


To get working,

1. download the latest version of jmusic (jmusic1.6.5.jar) right here https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmusic/files/jMusic_Stable/1.6.5/
2. open up eclipse and start a new java project
3. import the library: right click on your project, then "build path" -> "add external archives" -> click the jmusic.jar file you downloaded
4. put the code from  Music.java in the class and press Run!
